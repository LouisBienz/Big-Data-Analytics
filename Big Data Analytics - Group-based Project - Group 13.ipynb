    "\n",
    "Brawl Stars is a mobile online multiplayer battle game. A player choses a Brawler as game character and plays against other players or AI opponents. Currently there exist 36 different Brawlers, which a player can choose from. Each Brawler has a power level from 1 to 10. With the help of the in-game loot boxes those power levels can be upgraded.\n",
    "There are several playable modes, which are updated in regular intervals (every 24hours). Of course, it should also be mentioned that each mode has its preferred characters.\n",
    "There exist several game modes, where you either play solo or in a team of 2 or 3 against other players/teams or AI opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every groupmember is an active Brawl Stars gamer. That's the reason why we have decided to analyse some interesting insights of the Brawl Stars dataset. In the video below, you can see a small snipet of the mode \"Brawlball\". Brawlball is a 3 vs 3 match configuration, where your teams needs to score 2 goals against the opponent to win. In case you get attacked and killed by the opponents, you are out of the game for 10 seconds. This increases the chance of the opponent team for scoring an opposing goal. "
