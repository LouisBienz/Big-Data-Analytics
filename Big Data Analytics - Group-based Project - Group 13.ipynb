Currently there exist 36 different Brawlers, which a player can choose from. Each Brawler has a power level from 1 to 10. With the help of the in-game loot boxes those power levels can be upgraded.\n",
    "There are several playable modes, which are updated in regular intervals (every 24hours). Of course, it should also be mentioned that each mode has its preferred characters.\n",
    "There exist several game modes, where you either play solo or in a team of 2 or 3 against other players/teams or AI opponents.\n",
